# What's this?

Do you want to run an archive node + block explorer in your machine using only 1 command and (_almost_) no devops knowledge?

This repo provides a series of pre-configured docker compose files that spin-up a Prysm (consensus layer client) + Erigon (execution layer archive node; alpha series) + Otterscan (block explorer).

Just follow the instructions, fill in the gaps and run it. Or customize it for your needs. Or improve it and contribute it back, it's all opensource.
